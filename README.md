# joomla2pelican
A simple script to convert a Joomla website to Pelican.
This was drafted for personal use, but I decided to upload this piece of code so that it can be used as a starting point by others. Maybe I'll enhance it and translate the comments in english later.
Before using this script, you have to install the J2XML extension in Joomla and then export your site. Most options and variables in my script seem to me very self explanatory.
